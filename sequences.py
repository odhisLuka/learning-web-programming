#there are several types o sequences, one of them is a string, for intance
name = "Luke"

#for example, this sequence allows some individual elements inside of a sequence. It uses an array
print(name[0])
print(name[1])
print(name[2])
# the square bracket takes an ordered sequence of elements inside a sequence and gets me access to that particular elemtent
# [0] will return letter L
# [1] will return letter u, etc.

# another sequence you can use is also called lists, as explained below

names = "Luke", "Trevor", "Odhiambo"

print(names[2])

#you can also have the code run all names at once as shown below
print(names)

#another sequcne is called TUPLES often used if you have a couple values that won't have to change but you need to store a pair of values; immutable values
